# SeverePains Timer Bot

- Discord.js Commision from SolarSoldier22

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Naereen/StrapDown.js.svg)](https://github.com/SeverePain/Discord-Counter-Bot/releases/)

This bot is a simple bot to start/stop/view timers that anyone can run on their VPS.

This project was only possible due to node.js and discord.js




### Self-Hosting Setup

- Download the zip
- Extract it onto your computer
- Change the config.json to the appropriate values
- Deploy it onto your desired VPS


### Heroku Warning:

If you are self-hosting on Heroku, anytime the bot shuts down or restarts, ALL the timers will be reset! It is much better to just run this on a dedicated VPS from DigitalOcean or Google Cloud!
